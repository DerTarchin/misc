            <p>
              Since it became a legal right in 1963 to be represented in court by a lawyer regardless financial standing, thousands of public service offices across the nation serve millions of clients annually. However they are immensely underfunded, greatly overwhelmed and significanly understaffed when regarding workload and manhours needed. <b>73 percent</b> of county-based public defender offices lacked the requisite number of attorneys to meet caseload standards; 23 percent of these offices had <b>less than half of the necessary attorneys</b> to meet caseload standards
            </p>
            <p>
              Different states and offices have different ways to deal with this crisis, in greatly damaging ways. Some state systems allow legal representatives to <b>turn down cases</b>, even murder cases, to keep caseload from endlessly increasing. Many attorneys use a "meet'em and plead'em" method to slow the onset of new cases, which is when an attorney meets with a client before a hearing and convinces them to plead guilty simply to get the case out of the way. This is a contributing factor to why 90% of indigent cases result in guilty pleas. Perhaps the most ironic and damaging tactic of all is that <b>43 states require indigent defendants to partially pay for legal fees, even though they are by definition unable to afford it</b>. South Dakota, for example, charges $92 an hour, which can result in a defendant owing a lawyer hundreds of dollars even if they are innocent. To make things worse, there are many cases where clients are fined or arrested for being unable to pay for their legal fees, which can create an endless cycle of fees and possibly arrests.

            <p>
              <h3 style="margin:0; margin-left: 35px;">For every $1 we spend on public defense, taxpayers spend $14 on corrections.</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              This highlights the importance of possible solutions for this crisis, and how important it is to act now to make the future a better place with less crimes and cases.
              <br>Here are some possible solutions:
              <ul>
                <li><u>More resources:</u> With more funding and staff members, public defenders can focus more on each case and increase the quality of their representation for each client.</li>
                <li><u>Involve public defenders in policymaking process:</u> Public defenders have the unique position of knowing exactly how each policy and law affects the masses, so their opinion is valuable and should be taken into account when new laws are being drafted.</li>
                <li><u>Raise awareness:</u> Involving the community can help bring awareness and shift public focus from funding overcrowded prisons and the need for more policing to reducing the number of defendants in the first place. By providing fair representation, the quality of communities and lifestyle will increase, resulting in less crimes and false arrests.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
